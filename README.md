**Initial sketch and assignment understanding**
Going into this assignment, I wanted to focus on pop culture. Specifically on my anime figures. I was planning on having the figure/s be the main focus and somewhat 'glow' while the background stayed neutral or had no change at all. Even though I enjoyed the idea, I wasn't able to continue due to the AI not being able to pick up what I wanted:

Images masked by me:

Because of this I quickly changed to an idea that could be easy for the AI system to understand and be able to mask out. Because of this I decided to grab images that I took of the ocean. I figured that the AI would be able to easily understand the different environment compared ot my previous idea where the environment was quite different from each image.
