**Initial sketch and assignment understanding**

Going into this assignment, I wanted to focus on pop culture. Specifically on my anime figures. I was planning on having the figure/s be the main focus and somewhat 'glow' while the background stayed neutral or had no change at all. Even though I enjoyed the idea, I wasn't able to continue due to the AI not being able to pick up what I wanted:

Because of this, I had to quickly change to an idea that could be easy for the AI system to understand and to mask out. I decided to grab images that I captured of the ocean but was also pleasant to look at. I figured that the AI would be able to easily understand the different environments and pick out what to mask out compared to my previous idea where the environment was quite different from each image. I decided to have the ocean in each image be masked out and was positive that the AI would be able to mask the ocean out.
